# Machine Learning Template Repository

This repository contains a template for all of my ML projects. The template includes the following components:

- Basic project structure, including directories for models, dataloaders, tests, etc.
- A basic pyproject.toml file, including imports I use in most projects.
- An argument parser set up with CLI arguments I usually use.

Once you make your own project from this repository, create a virtual environment, enter it, then run `pip install -e .`
